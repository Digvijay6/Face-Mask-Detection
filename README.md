# Face Mask Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a Face Mask Detection system, a computer vision application that utilizes machine learning to identify whether individuals in images or video streams are wearing face masks or not. The system aims to contribute to public health and safety, particularly during situations like pandemics where wearing masks is crucial.

## Features

Face Detection: Utilizes face detection algorithms to identify faces within images or video frames.
Mask Classification: Employs a machine learning model to classify whether a detected face is wearing a mask or not.
Real-time Detection: Provides real-time detection capabilities for live video streams.
Accuracy Metrics: Includes metrics to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the model.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for the application.
OpenCV: Used for image and video processing, including face detection.
TensorFlow & Keras: Employed for building and training the face mask classification model.
